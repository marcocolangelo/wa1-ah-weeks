# Exercise 8: React Q&A, now with state

_Goal: Getting started with the state by adding it to the "HeapOverrun" React app developed last week._

## Adding the state

Define where to put the state in the app and how many state variables you need, reflecting on the pros and cons. 

Use the 'fake' set of questions and answers to initialize the state. Update the existing components accordingly.

## Implement the "delete" function

Add a button, besides each answer, to delete that answer from the list.

Use the defined state and decide where to put the function to delete the element.

## Implement the "vote up" function

Make the "vote up" function of each answer work! By clicking on the button associated with an answer, the information about the answer's score must be increased by 1.

Use the defined state and decide where to put the function to increase the score.
